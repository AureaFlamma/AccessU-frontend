## ‚ôø Access+ App

&nbsp; Hello and thanks for your interest in our web app.

&nbsp; We hope you find this document helpful in understanding the problem we aimed to solve, the solution&nbsp; &nbsp; or app we created to solve this problem, how to install the app, details about what's going on in the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; code and how to use it. 

</br></br>

## :x: The Problem 

</br>

- 1 in 4 households are impacted by disability
¬†¬†

- 98% of disabled people look for accessibility information before visiting somewhere for the first time.

- Over 75% of disabled people don‚Äôt visit somewhere they wanted to go because they couldn‚Äôt find the accessibility information they needed.

- This results in disabled people making 26% fewer trips than those without a disability.

In your .env file, you'll need to use the following format.

```

PGHOST=

PGUSER=

PGDATABASE=

## üìö API Reference

</br>

### To GET All Resources:

</br>

GET http://localhost:3001/resources/

This returns the entire contents of the database.

</br>

### To GET Resources by ID:

</br>

GET http://localhost:3001/resources/{id}

e.g. GET http://localhost:3001/resources/4

</br>

This returns:

```
 {

"success": true,

 "payload": [
     {
         "id": 4,
         "url": "https://linguinecode.com/post/react-usereducer-vs-usestate",
         "title": "React useReducer vs React useState: When to use one over the other?",
         "type": "Article",
         "topic": "React",
         "description": "An article about what React.useReducer is used for, and when to use it instead ofReact.useState"
         "isFavourite": "false"
     }
 ]

}
```

</br>

The value of isFavourite is a string instead of a boolean.

### To GET Resources by title:

</br>

GET http://localhost:3001/resources?title=value

</br>

e.g. GET http://localhost:3001/resources?title=react

</br>

This returns:

    "payload": [
        {
            "id": 2,
            "url": "https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet/",
            "title": "A cheatsheet for the React Testing Library",
            "type": "Documentation",
            "topic": "React",
            "description": "A short guide to all the exported functions in React Testing Library"
            "isFavourite": "false"
        },
        {
            "id": 4,
            "url": "https://linguinecode.com/post/react-usereducer-vs-usestate",

        }
    ]
}
```

## üéì Lessons Learned

</br>

Teamwork makes the dream work..

</br>

Break down every problem and then do it again and again..

</br>

Standups and Retros really helped us keep a great rhythm and revise our plan incrementally..

</br>

Keep open communication and share the problems you have when needed, we‚Äôre better together..

</br>

Take your breaks after the mini sprints, stay hydrated and encourage everyone to take a break from the screen..

</br>

Let things go if need be.. Sometimes it‚Äôs just not worth it..
