# üíñ Our values

1. **Foster an atmosphere of psychological safety.** No stupid questions/ideas.
2. **Communicate with each other even when it's uncomfortable.** When we‚Äôre doing something we do it together and communicate what we are doing and when.
3. **Be inclusive and respectful** of each other‚Äôs beliefs and points of view.
4. **Shared Ownership**- we all own the product.
5. **We remember that we are all working towards the same goal**; despite our differences on how to get there, it‚Äôs us against the problem not us against each other.

</br>

# üòµ‚Äçüí´ In case of indecisiveness/conflict break glass

**Step 1**: Talk about the problem for a set amount of time. Use a timer.

- if it's a conflict, make sure all sides of the conflict have equal amount time to speak
- Aim to establish a compormise

**Step 2**: Dot voting.</br>

_Remember to conduct discussions in a calm manner. if the conflict gwets heated, go back to the values part of manifesto_

# üåä GitHub Flow

1. **Create a new branch.** No one works on main
2. **Make changes**:
   - Add comments as you go
   - Plan inside [Dev Log](./Dev_log.md) and tick things off as you go.
   - Important things (variable names, shape of data etc.) also to be put in [Dev Log](./Dev_log.md)
3. **Add-Commit-Push**
   - Commit names to be descriptive: sentences, not words.
   - Atomic commits: one task per commit.
4. **Review**
   - Done as a group
5. **Deploy**
6. **Merge**

_**Out of hours**: No expectation to work after hours | All after-hours work needs to be approved by the team beforehand (team mates need to be invited to join) | No guarantee after-hours changes will be deployed -> subject to team approval_

# üíé Nadeem's wisdom nuggets

1. Have a working frontend before you start coding the backend (use mock back-end)
2. You're demoing the product, not the code. The code is **a** way of achieving the product.
3. Disagree and commit: If you disagree with direction the project is going, **you speak up.** Conversely, if we agree to go a certain direction, **you commit** and do your best to take the project in that direction.
4. Demonstrate your capacity to learn- the point is for everyone to dip toes in every aspect of the project and not to pigeonhole ourselves.
5. Pritoritize tickets according to importance, not any other factor (e.g. complexity etc.)
6. PResentation:

- What is your problem?
- What is the solution?
- How did you work towards that solution?
- Did you achieve the solution? How did you know you did?
